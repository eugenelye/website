        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p >
          This project is about creating a game called "Guitar Hero". It is
          simplified version of the Guitar Hero game. This game was chosen for the
          project as it is a game where most people will know how to play and it
          is simple for children to play as well. The vibrant colors of the game
          also create a feel good factor for the players.
        </p>
  
        <h2 >Instructions</h2>
        <p >
          When the "Start Game" button is pressed, the blocks will start falling.
        </p>
        <p >
          Users will have to press the associated keys shown on the screen when
          the keys fall to the bottom of the screen.
        </p>
        <p >
          When the correct key is pressed as the block is at the bottom, it will
          register a score.
        </p>
        <p >
          If the key is not pressed when the block falls beyond the bottom of the
          screen, it will register a miss.
        </p>
        <p >
          The game will end if there are more than 5 misses or the game time of 30
          seconds are up.
        </p>

        <h2 >Programming Languages</h2>
  
        <p >
          HTML CSS and Javascript are the programming langagues used for this
          project.

        <h2 >Challenges of the Project</h2>
        <h3 >
          Making the rectangles falling randomly
        </h3>
        <p >
          Initially, the rectangles were created randomly and condition were set
          to make it fall again once it reaches the bottom. However this is not
          random as the block which fall to the botom first will be generated
          again on top, creating a standard loop. After that it was changed to
          making rectangles in a setTimeout function so that it is generated every
          3000/speed timing.
        </p>
        <h3 >
          Making the rectangles stop falling after the time ends or misses reach a
          certain number.
        </h3>
        <p >
          I could not make the animation stop as initially, I put the function of
          fallRect in the clear interval. After realising that it needs to be
          asssigned to a variable, the clearInterval works. This is one of the
          things I learned in doing this project.
        </p>

          Known Problems of The Game
        </h2>
        <p >
          The score and the game over are shown in an alert function. It can be
          improved by showing it as a pop up box of text, beautifying the score
          and the interface of the game. The interface of the game can also be
          improved by allowing game users to change the game time and the speed of
          the falling blocks.
