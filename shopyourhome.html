        <h2>Technical Used </h2>
        <p >
          The app was created using MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJs, aka MERN.
          Other libraries such as React-Router-Dom are used to navigate through
          the app. Tailwind CSS was used to design the app.
        </p>
  
        <h2>User Stories and Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          This project is about creating an app called "ShopYourHome". It is a
          modern furniture shop, which allows users to create an account and shop
          through the items. The categories of items includes Living , Dining,
          Kitchen, Bath and Bedroom. Users can browse through the products in
          different categories. If they want to buy a product, they can add to
          their cart. Upon completing the browsing, they can check out their cart
          and the order history can be tracked through the order page.The
          different wireframes such as the products , cart and orders page are
          shown below.
        </p>
        <h3>Products</h3>

          Planning and Development Process
        </h2>
        <h3>Setting Up of Database</h3>
        <p>
          There are two collections to facilitate the retrieval of data from the
          database, furniture and users.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Furniture collection</h3>
        <p>
          The furniture database was set up with the furniture name, price ,
          image, description and category. This collection allows the website to
          render the products , allowing users to buy the items. The category
          value allows the filtering of items to be rendered on different pages
          through Express. When users add to cart or buy the products, the
          furnitures are added to the users collection.
        </p>

        <h3>Users collection</h3>
        <p>
          The users collection comprises of username, password, , name, address ,
          furniture and orders. When users add products to their cart, the
          furniture are added to the user's furniture object. When users checkout,
          the products in furniture are transfered to the orders object and
          deleted from the furniture object. This data structure allows for users
          to store items in their cart and look through their order history.
        </p>

        <h3>Improvements in the future</h3>
        <p>
          The function below can be implemented in the future to further improve
          the website.
        </p>
        <h3>Editing of Products</h3>
        <p>
          Users can be checked whether they are admin of the wesbite. If they are
          admin of the websites, they can edit the product details so that the
          products on the website can be updated.
        </p>
        <h3>Tally of orders</h3>
        <p>
          The total orders on the website for all the users can be tallied and
          admin of the website can check the revenue gain every month.
        </p>
        <h3>Deleting of users</h3>
        <p>
          Admin of the website can also delete users account so that they cannot
          buy any products from the website. The reason could be some of the users
          did not pay for their products or creating nuisance to the shop.
