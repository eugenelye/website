        <h1>StockTrack</h1>
        <p>
          This project is about creating a React App to search and track finance
          data such as Stocks, Forex and Cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This project is about creating an app called "StockTrack". It allows
          users to find real time stock, forex and crypto data from an API called
          TwelveData and Yahoo Finance. It has a search function which allows
          users to input the stock name, forex pair and cryptocurrency symbol in
          their respective pages and retrieve the prices, exchange rate and the
          cryptocurrency prices in the searched currency. It also allows the user
          to add in their favourites to a portfolio so that they can track the
          prices of the searched items.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Technical Used</h2>
        <p>
          The app was created using React JS. Other libraries such as
          React-Router-Dom and Alice Carousel was used to navigate the app and
          show the effects of the carousell respectively.
        </p>
        <p >Async was used to fetch the data from the API.</p>
        <p >
          CSS was also used to create the background effects and beautify the data
          rendered.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Component Model</h2>
  
        <p>
          Pages such as Home, Stocks, Forex, Cryptocurrency and Portfolio are used
          to naviage around the app. The main App is used to filter the data and
          render the results to the respective pages. StockCarousel, ForexCarousel
          and CryptoCarousel are used to create the carousel effect on the pages.
          NavBar is the compoenent which directs the users to the respective pages
          with links.

        <h2>User Stories </h2>
        <h3 >Stock Function</h3>
        <p>
          This stock search page allows users to input the stock of the data they
          wish to retrieve. This search input can be in the form of the name of
          the company or the stock symbol. For example , if the user wish to
          retrieve the stock price of Apple Inc. stock in USD, they can either
          input 'apple' or 'aapl'. Both terms will render the result of Apple Inc.
          stock name ,price and 24 hours percentage change.
        </p>

        />
  
        <h3>Forex Function</h3>
        <p>
          The forex search page allows the users to search the forex data. For
          example , users shall input SGD/EUR and they will be able to see the
          data of the current exchange rate and the 24 hour percentage change.
        </p>

        <h3>Crypto Function</h3>
        <p>
          This cryptocurrency search allows users to search the cryptocurrency
          prices. Users shall input the cryptocurrency symbol and currency, for
          example BTC/USD , and the BTC name , price in USD and 24 hours
          percentage change will be rendered. Users can also search it in other
          currencies, such as BTC/SGD to obtain the price in SGD.
        </p>

        />
  
        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
          When the stocks, forex or cryptocurrency is searched, their data can be
          stored in the portfolio of the user by pressing the star icon. The data
          will be stored in the My portfolio page.
        </p>

        <h2 >Planning and Development Process</h2>
        <h3 >Problem-Solving Strategy</h3>
        <h4 >Pages</h4>
        <p >
          Pages are set up using React-Router-Dom and used as links and
          componenets for the purpose of this app. As the results of stocks, forex
          and cryptocurrency are different in format (eg. prices and exchange
          rate), it will be simpler to seperate them into different pages so that
          each pages can render the results in the different formats. Hence 3
          different pages are set up to render the 3 different types of financial
          data.
        </p>
        <p >
          For the inputs, it would also be simpler to set them up in the
          respective pages as the inputs will be saved and passed into the
          respective functions for the rendering of the data. The filtering of
          data for all the 3 types of data are saved in the App.js as they are
          similar. Hence saving them in App.js allows for quicker coding as the
          functions can be duplicating. The different states are then prop into
          different pages for mapping the data display.
        </p>
  
        <h4 >Components</h4>
        <p >
          The Navbar component is created for the purpose of design of the
          navigation bar and navigate users to different pages.
        </p>
        <p >
          Carousell pages are set up for the rendering of major stock, forex and
          cryptocurrency data in a carousell effect. This would allow the app to
          look more interactive with the dynamic movement of the data.
        </p>
        <p >
          The rendering of data through the API with a fixed array of input for
          the carousel effect was more difficult to solve. In the end, forEach was
          used to input the data into the API and mapped out the different data.
        </p>
        <h2 >Unsolved problems</h2>
        <h3 >Stock Search</h3>
  
        <p >
          Future improvement can be made by allowing users to change the currency
          so that they can see the stock prices in their preferred currency
          instead of just USD.
        </p>
        <p>
          List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
        </p>
        <h3 >Crypto Function</h3>
  
        <p >
          The search can be improved by allowing users to search both the name or
          the symbol to get the cryptocurrency prices data. A drop down menu can
          also be implmented to allow users to select the closest match.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
  
        <p >
          This page can be further improved by allowing users to input buy orders
          at the current price and track their buy orders. The portfolio can allow
          users to have a overall portfolio value data and see their profit or
          losses on their buy orders.
        </p>
  
        <h3 >API used</h3>
  
        <p >
          TwelveData API (https://twelvedata.com/) - This API was used to retrieve
          the price by inputting the symbol. For the cryptocurrency app, the name
          and the symbol was both available in the API to display.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
    
          Yahoo Finance API (https://yfapi.net) - This API was added for the
          stocks to be searched with either the name or symbol. The API was used
          as an autocomplete function hence it will filter out the closest matched
          stock data with your input. Thereafter, the symbol was retrieved from
          the data to input into the TwelveData API for data fetching.
        </p>
        <p >
     
          However, one thing to note is that the Yahoo Finance API key changes
          everyday. The key in the codes will need to be updated.
